			<h2><u>What is HTML?</u></h2>
			<p><strong>HTML</strong> <i>(Hyper Text Markup Language)</i> is a markup language that can be used to create a website. Without HTML, your web browser would not be able to read what's on a website.</p>
			<p>The good thing is that all web browsers understand HTML! HTML doesn't need to be downloaded or installed - all web browsers already understand it. In fact, try making a .html file right now! You'll be able to open it right in your web browser. Of course, it'll be empty, since it's a blank file. So how do we add things to it?</p>
			<h2><u>Finding a Text Editor</u></h2>
			<p>.html files are just text, so you can really use any text editor to code, even Notepad! Some text editors will have more capabilities, such as syntax colours and autocompletion of tags and code. If you want to have these features, consider downloading a more advanced text editor, such as Atom, Brackets, Notepad++, Sublime, or Dreamweaver.</p>
